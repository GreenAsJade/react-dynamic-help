# react-dynamic-help
Create flows of helpful prompts in your react application.

This library is intended to pop up help for the user _while they use the app_.

(In contrast to the common "tour based" help libraries, which "show your user the app in action" while they click "Next".)

The app interaction is intended to be minimally intrusive in the app codebase.

The app interacts primarily by registering elements as "help targets", and calling a callback to indicate that the target has been used.
```js
function AppWithHelp(): JSX.Element {
   return (
       <DynamicHelp.HelpProvider>
           <App />
           <HelpFlows />
       </DynamicHelp.HelpProvider>
   );
}

export const AComponent = (props: ConfigProps): JSX.Element => {

   const { registerTargetItem } = React.useContext(DynamicHelp.Api);

   const { ref: addStatButton, used: signalAddStatUsed } =
       registerTargetItem("add-stat-button");

   const addStat = () => {
       setNewStatEntryOpen(true);
       signalAddStatUsed();
   };

   return ( // ...
                   <FA
                       ref={addStatButton}
                       icon={faCirclePlus}
                       onClick={addStat}
                   />

```

Help Items and their Flows are specified in a separate JSX tree.

```js
export function HelpFlows(): JSX.Element {
   return (
       <div className="help-flow-container">
           <HelpFlow id="new-user" showInitially={true}>
               <HelpItem target="help-toggle">
                   <div>Click here to see more Dynamic Help</div>
               </HelpItem>
           </HelpFlow>

           <HelpFlow id="basic" showInitially={false}>
               <HelpItem target="add-stat-button">
                   <div>Click to add a stat</div>
               </HelpItem>
               <HelpItem target="stat-name-input" position="bottom-centre">
                   <div>Enter the name for a stat</div>
               </HelpItem>
               <HelpItem target="dice-chooser" position="bottom-center">
                   <div>Choose a dice type</div>
               </HelpItem>
               <HelpItem id="help-for-stat-ok" target="stat-ok">
                   <div>OK?</div>

// â€¦
```

Things to do:

 - Make sure that deleted flows (and renamed ones) are removed from stored state.

 - Support a no-op pseudo Item somehow, so you can have a break in a flow, with a resume.
    - Wouldn't this just amount to "start another flow?"
       - It's not the same, because "start another flow" calls for app interaction, this should be doable in the HelpFlow/Item definition.

 - Support showing multiple Help Items at a single step in the flow.

 - Have the standard Help Item layout be more "callout like", so it indicates clearly what the target is.

 - Be able to target items via css selector as an alternative to ref
    - Don't know if it is even possible.
    - Note that this would not support registration based features, but would be even less imact on the app.

 - Fix up the packaging

This library was packaged following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRmLTZyq57U

It turns out this might not have been the best choice of packaging guide.   The current packaging seems to work, but is non-standard (does not include the source) and cumbersome (manually copying CSS for example).
